# Video Game Trivia
> Homework assignment: University of Richmond Full Stack Boot Camp 

## Overview
 The game begins with a simple start page featuring the game's instructions and a button to begin the game.

When the button is pressed, the instructions and button are hidden. Seven questions appear, and a timer begins at 70 seconds. The player answers the questions with the radio buttons below the questions. The player can press the submit button to complete the game, and they will be taken to the results page.

However, if the time runs out, the player is alerted that they have run out of time and will be automatically taken to the results page.

On the results page, the player will be shown the number of correct and incorrect responses. If the player chooses to do so, they can press a restart button to return to the questions screen with the timer being reset and the radio responses being cleared.
